# MyDiet Development Todo List

## Core Functionality Issues

### Database & Backend
- [ ] **Run database migrations automatically on startup** - Currently migrations need to be run manually
- [ ] **Implement proper Delete functionality** - Delete method in meals.go is commented out and incomplete
- [ ] **Add data validation** - No validation for food quantities, negative values, etc.
- [ ] **Fix hardcoded user ID** - Currently hardcoded to user ID 1, should support multiple users

### User Interface & Experience
- [ ] **Add spinner when users search for food** - No loading indicator during search
- [ ] **Add popup/notification for error messages** - Errors are only logged, not shown to user
- [ ] **Separate models from views** - Current architecture mixes model logic with view logic
- [ ] **Add right panel/box** - UI layout is incomplete
- [ ] **Improve navigation between meal windows** - Should have 4 distinct meal sections (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)

### Form & Input Handling
- [ ] **Complete Huh form integration** - Form functionality is partially implemented but incomplete
- [ ] **Implement proper unit selection** - Food units exist in DB but form doesn't handle them properly
- [ ] **Add input validation in forms** - No validation for quantity, negative numbers, etc.
- [ ] **Fix form navigation/back functionality** - Issue mentioned as fixed but may need verification

## Missing Features

### Essential Features
- [ ] **Add comprehensive test suite** - No tests exist currently
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling throughout app** - Many errors are just logged but not handled
- [ ] **Add help/instructions view** - No user guidance within the app
- [ ] **Implement daily/weekly/monthly nutrition summaries** - Only shows individual items
- [ ] **Add food editing/modification capabilities** - Can only add, not edit existing entries

### Data Management
- [ ] **Add nutrition goals/targets** - No way to set daily calorie/macro targets
- [ ] **Implement food history/favorites** - No quick access to recently used foods
- [ ] **Add bulk food entry** - Currently one item at a time
- [ ] **Export data functionality** - No way to export nutrition data
- [ ] **Add backup/restore functionality** - Database could be lost

### Search & Discovery
- [ ] **Improve food search with fuzzy matching** - Currently only prefix matching
- [ ] **Add food categories/filtering** - No way to browse foods by category
- [ ] **Implement barcode scanning (future)** - Would require external API integration
- [ ] **Add custom food creation** - Users can't add their own foods to database

## Code Quality & Architecture

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Set up testing framework** - Add testify or similar Go testing framework
- [ ] **Add unit tests for store layer** - Database operations should have tests
- [ ] **Add integration tests for UI flows** - Test full user workflows
- [ ] **Set up linting** - Add golangci-lint or similar
- [ ] **Add pre-commit hooks** - Ensure code quality on commits

### Documentation & Setup
- [ ] **Add API documentation** - Document internal APIs and data structures
- [ ] **Create development guide** - How to set up dev environment
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Document keyboard shortcuts** - User needs to know available keys

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Add database indexing** - Improve search performance
- [ ] **Implement caching for frequently accessed data** - Food search results, etc.
- [ ] **Optimize UI rendering** - May have performance issues with large datasets
- [ ] **Add pagination for large food lists** - Currently loads all results

## Platform & Distribution
- [ ] **Add cross-platform build scripts** - Currently only manual build
- [ ] **Create installation packages** - deb, rpm, brew formula, etc.
- [ ] **Add configuration file support** - Allow user customization
- [ ] **Implement proper logging levels** - Currently logs everything

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Web interface option** - Additional to terminal interface
- [ ] **Mobile app companion** - For easier food logging on-the-go
- [ ] **Integration with fitness trackers** - Sync calorie burn data
- [ ] **Meal planning features** - Plan future meals
- [ ] **Recipe management** - Store and track complete recipes
- [ ] **Social features** - Share meals, compare with friends

## Priority Order
**High Priority:** Database migrations, error handling, form completion, testing setup
**Medium Priority:** UI improvements, search enhancements, data validation
**Low Priority:** Advanced features, platform distribution, future enhancements

## Notes
- The application builds successfully but has several incomplete features
- Focus on core functionality before adding new features
- Ensure proper error handling is implemented throughout
- Testing is critical - currently has zero test coverage
